	<p>Sometimes, you'll want to use code you didn't write. There are
	a lot of reasons you might want to do this. Usually it's because
	you're trying to do something hard, and someone has already solved
	the problem for you</p>
	<p>Of course, not all code is good, so you should make sure the source
	is credible, but that's beyond the scope of this task.</p>
	<p>To use someone else's code, you just have to <code>import</code> it</p>
	<p>An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA often automatically inserts an import statement,
	but you should still understand how to do it by hand.</p>
