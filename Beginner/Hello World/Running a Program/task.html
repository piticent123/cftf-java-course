	<p>The first program any programmer makes in any language is "Hello, world".
	It displays the phrase "Hello, world" on the screen. I've written
		one up in Java for you. Try to run it!</p>
	<p>There are a lot of challenges to a "Hello, world" program that
	aren't really applicable when developing in an IDE, but it still tells
	you that Java is correctly installed on your computer, which is important!</p>
