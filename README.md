# CFTF Java Course

This is a course in Java for campers at [Camp Fitch](https://campcomputer.com).
It is meant to be used in Jetbrain's IntelliJ IDEA with the EduTools
plugin.

There are 3 sections - beginner, intermediate, and advanced. It lines up with how
we usually divide campers and what they usually learn over the course of 1 week.

Beginner teaches most aspects of the language - enough to "make you dangerous".

Intermediate teaches the remaining features of the language and focuses on putting
more of your skills together.

Advanced focuses more on the applications of Java and more of how it's actually
used in industry.
